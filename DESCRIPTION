        differential expression and splicing

Description: The package generally provides methods for gene set
        enrichment analysis of high-throughput RNA-Seq data by
        integrating differential expression and splicing. It uses
        negative binomial distribution to model read count data, which
        accounts for sequencing biases and biological variation. Based
        on permutation tests, statistical significance can also be
        achieved regarding each gene's differential expression and
        splicing, respectively.
